# Text_classification_using_transformers
The code performs semantic analysis using a transformer designed from scratch using TensorFlow. 

The analysis is performed on IMDB dataset which can be easily imported from Keras Datasets.

The impelementation is loosely based on the 2017 paper "Attention is All you Need". The full citation of the article is provided below.

The transformer is trained to classify whether the text corresponds to positive review or a negative review.

The implementation is based on Tensorflow so all you need to do is install tensorflow package. The code is tested on Tensorflow 2.4.0 so it is recommended to install the said version.
